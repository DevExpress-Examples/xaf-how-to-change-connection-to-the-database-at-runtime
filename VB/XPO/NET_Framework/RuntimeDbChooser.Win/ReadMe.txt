Project Description

This project implements a WinForms application. The root project folder 
contains the WinApplication.cs(vb) file with the class that inherits WinApplication.
This class can be designed with the Application Designer that allows
you to view and customize application components: referenced modules, security settings,
data connection. Additionally, the root folder contains Application Model
difference files (XAFML files) that keep application settings specific for the
current application. Difference files can be designed with the Model Editor.
